**and** constructs language-aware lists in R. It extends the functionality of functions like `knitr::combine_words()` and `glue::glue_collapse()` to make _and_-separated and _or_-separated lists that automatically conform to the user's R language settings.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **and** from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=and) with:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("and")
```

or the development version of **and** from [GitHub](https://github.com/rossellhayes/and) with:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("rossellhayes/and")
```

## Usage

```{r include = FALSE}
library(and)
```

`and()` creates "and"-separated lists from vectors.

```{r}
names <- c("John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo")
and(names)
```

But the Oxford comma is less common in other varieties of English, what happens if I change my R language to British English?

```{r}
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "en_GB")
and(names)
```

What about other languages?

```{r}
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "es")
and(names)
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "eu")
and(names)
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "ko")
and(names)
```

### Handling the nuances

Creating a list is not as simple as putting a different word between the last two items.
For example, in Spanish, the word for _and_ changes if the next word starts with an ⟨i⟩  or ⟨y⟩:

```{r}
princess_bride <- c("Vizzini", "Fezzik", "Inigo Montoya")
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "es")
and(princess_bride)
```

### _or_-separated lists

Everything `and()` can do `or()` can do better. Just use `or()` to create _or_-separated lists with all the same contextual awareness.

```{r}
outcomes <- c("win", "lose", "draw")
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "en_US")
or(outcomes)
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "ja")
or(outcomes)
```

### Hardcoding language

Don't want the language of you string to depend on the user's environment variables?
You can explicitly set the language using the `language` argument.

```{r}
and(names, language = "en_US")
and(names, language = "en_GB")
and(names, language = "es")
and(names, language = "fr")
```
